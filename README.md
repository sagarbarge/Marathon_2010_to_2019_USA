# About this file:

This file contains the individual results of each finisher. The year and race are indicated, and each record includes the runner's name, gender, age, finish time in seconds, and age bracket according to the BAA qualification rules for the Boston Marathon. An age of -1 indicates that the source data did not include an age value.

The parameters for inclusion into the sample were that the marathon took place in the United States in September, October, or November, and that there were at least 500 finishers. Author selected these months to reduce the chances that a runner would participate in two marathons in the same year and because they are popular months for racing in the United States. While the floor of 500 finishers reduced the total number of races to be included in the sample, it did not appreciably reduce the number of finishers.
